# fresh_air_bristol

https://github.com/sz16900/fresh_air_bristol.git

A website for displaying air quality data from Bristol.gov.uk as a heat map and historic graphs.
Data available as JSON and API:
https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/resource/mc7c-bzcy.json

We plan to use SODA API and Google Maps Javascript API to display the data.
Node.js will be used to retrive the data.
The website will also contain historic air quality data in a database that the user can
access to view and/or download air quality data.
The database will be updated as new data is retrieved from: opendata.bristol.gov.uk/resource/mc7c-bzcy.json
